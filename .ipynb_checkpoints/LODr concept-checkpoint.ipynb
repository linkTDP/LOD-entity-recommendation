      "-\tBoth a news article and a Twitris campaign can be described through a set of entities. We can utilize NER Api to extract the entities contained in news article, while Twitris already extract entities for each campaign.\n",
      "-\tA news article is better understandable and less wide than a Twitrist campaign and that can make easier the developing of the technique.\n",
      "-\tWhen the technique will be developed and tested, we can easily adapt it to work with Twitris. \n",
      "\n",
      "This idea is based on the assumption that usually in a news article not all the information are make explicit by the author for brevity reasons. The user should usually own a basic background knowledge to fully understand the article. This implicit knowledge can be found in general domain knowledge graphs and DBPedia is certainly the best candidate.\n",

I want to use network analysis techniques to infer witch entities of this subgraph can represent the implicit knowledge of the article *A*. The huge number of instances and links between them of DBPedia requires careful techniques on the extraction of the subgraph *st* if we want that techniques of network analysis are effective.\n",
